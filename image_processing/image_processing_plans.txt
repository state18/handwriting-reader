Image Processing 6112
------------------
- Using Otsu's threshold, binarize image.
- Get connected components. Compute average size.
- Eliminate components that are outliers to average size.
	- Note: This imposes the constraint that text must be written in similar size in entire image.
			We may want to eliminate this step and handle extraneous components during post-processing.
- Look through each component from top-left to bottom-right.
	- From left to right, try to link together components that occupies similar row space.
		These form a "line".
- Iterate through each line's components:
	- From left to right, look for gaps between components that are significant. This gap size is determined
		by global component statistics. We now have "words"
- For each word:
	- Look for columns with no FG pixels. Split here.

For each segmented cluster:
	Classify as character. Link association with word and line for speech synthesis.
	
	
	
	
Update: 4/12/2018:
- Puncuation isolation (look for periods, prune out any small components above
XXX Touching separation: Top-down profile check for steep valleys for extra wide bboxes
- Image preprocessing- Noise/Lighting thresholding in real paper handwritten documents
