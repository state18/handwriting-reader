Pipeline:

Handwriting recognition
	1) Isolate text:
		- Perform FG segmentation.
		- We assume we can encompass the entirely of the text in one bounding box.
	2) Divide bounding box horizontally depending on foreground placement.
		- We cannot handle text that is sporatically placed.
	3) Vertical segmentation based on word.

	4) Vertical segmentation based on character.

	5) Character recognition

Text to speech
	1) Likely use third party library for this

Answering a question (if applicable)
	1) Identify if question (question mark or keywords when/why/how etc...)
	2) ???
